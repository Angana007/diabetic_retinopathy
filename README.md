# Diabetic Retinopathy Detection using CNNs and Transfer learning

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common complications of diabetes and a leading cause of preventable blindness in working-age adults worldwide. It occurs when high blood sugar levels damage the small blood vessels in the retina — the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye. This damage can cause the blood vessels to leak, swell, or close off entirely, leading to vision problems and eventually blindness if left untreated.

🤖 Why This Project Is Useful
By automating the detection of diabetic retinopathy from fundus images, this project demonstrates how AI can assist clinicians in making faster, more reliable diagnoses. Benefits include:

🔁 Scalability: Can screen thousands of images without fatigue.

⚡ Speed: Enables real-time or near-real-time detection in clinical workflows.

🎯 Consistency: Reduces inter-observer variability in manual grading.

🌍 Accessibility: Supports DR screening in underserved or remote areas where specialists are limited.

Dataset Source
The dataset used in this project is from the [Diabetic Retinopathy Detection competition on Kaggle]. The images were provided by EyePACS for the purpose of developing automated methods to identify signs of diabetic retinopathy in retinal images.
